#### Final Project Summary

My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at how many Senators have filed blind trusts. A visualization idea is to show a graph of the number of blind trust filings by year. And, it’d also be interesting to break it down by party (Republican vs. Democratic).

Florida Governor is turning his attention to a possible U.S. Senate bid – a likely challenge to Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson in November. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is already anticipating this challenge. On Monday, the DSCC released two internet advertisements critical of the multi-millionaire governor’s use of blind trusts to handle his personal finances.

Democrats are hammering Rick Scott with two new digital ads being released Monday, raising questions about his financial blind trust and his missing nursing home voicemails. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is releasing the digital ads “Truth” and “Blind,” and both question whether Rick Scott is using the governor’s office to enhance his own wealth. The “Blind” ad raises questions about potential conflicts of interest and suggests that Scott has handled his finances in a way as governor that would not be permitted if and when he runs for federal office.

Scott vs. Nelson for Senate? If so, governor will have a lot more disclosing to do - http://www.floridabulldog.org/2018/02/scott-v-nelson-for-senate/

For two terms, Florida’s feeble blind trust law has let Governor Rick Scott stash his tens of millions of dollars in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, and oil and gas partnerships mostly out of sight and in friendly hands. Should he become a candidate for the U.S. Senate – Scott will face tougher federal financial disclosure rules that promise to expose more details about the size and scope of his enormous holdings. The blind trust is not a popular option on Capitol Hill. Only five senators currently have a Senate qualified blind trust (QBT). The Democrats: Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Joseph Manchin of West Virginia. The Republicans: Orrin Hatch of Utah and Johnny Isakson of Georgia.

In a letter, Senate Democrats press Trump to follow guidelines set out by the Office of Government Ethics to divest his business holdings and set up a blind trust that isn’t run by his own family members. Trump has said his three oldest children would take over the family business. But, that arrangement has raised potential ethical concerns.

The bill would require Trump to divest while implementing the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause. Elizabeth Warren said in a statement, “The American people deserve to know that the President of the United States is working to do what’s best for the country – not using his office to do what’s best for himself and his businesses. The only way for President-elect Trump to truly eliminate conflicts-of-interest is to divest his financial interests by placing them in a blind trust.”
